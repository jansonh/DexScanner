# DexScanner (unfinished project)

This is an unfinished toy project I was playing with to learn iOS app development. 
The idea is to create a Pokedex app like in the movie where the trainers can point their camera to a Pokemon and get the information in their screen.

The Pokedex and camera functionality _hopefully_ works, but I haven't added the ability to recognize Pokemon from an image. 
I had planned to train the DL model, but had to move on to something else, so...
